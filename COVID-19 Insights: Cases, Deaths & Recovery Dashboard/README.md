## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction  
The **COVID-19 Insights Dashboard** provides a visual breakdown of the pandemic‚Äôs global impact.  
It helps users understand infection trends, recovery rates, and regional disparities in real time ‚Äî allowing for data-driven decision-making and comparative analysis across countries.  

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Statement  
The global COVID-19 dataset contained millions of raw records without intuitive visibility into key indicators.  
Health professionals and policy makers needed a consolidated dashboard to:  
- Track total cases, deaths, and recoveries by country and WHO region.  
- Compare performance between continents.  
- Identify regions with slow recovery or high fatality rates.  

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Skills Demonstrated  
- SQL Data Extraction & Filtering  
- Data Cleaning and Preparation (Excel, Power Query)  
- Data Modelling (Star Schema)  
- DAX Calculations and Measures  
- Power BI Dashboard Design  
- Analytical Storytelling and Insight Communication  

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Sourcing  
**Source:** [Kaggle ‚Äì COVID-19 Global Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/)  
- Dataset includes daily country-level data: Confirmed Cases, Deaths, Recoveries, Active Cases, and WHO Region.  
- Data was imported first into **SQL** for initial querying and validation before being connected to **Power BI** for analysis.  

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Data Transformation  
Performed in **SQL** and **Power Query**:  
- Removed duplicates and nulls.  
- Created calculated columns:  
  - **Active Cases** = Confirmed ‚àí (Recovered + Deaths)  
  - **Recovery Rate (%)** = (Recovered / Confirmed) √ó 100  
  - **Death Rate (%)** = (Deaths / Confirmed) √ó 100  
- Grouped data by **WHO Region** for regional summaries.  
- Standardized column naming and formats for integration.  

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Modelling  
A **Star Schema** model was implemented for clear relationships between fact and dimension tables.  

üìò **Model Overview:**  
- **Fact Table:** COVID-19 daily records (cases, deaths, recoveries).  
- **Dimension Tables:** Country/Region, WHO Region, Death Rate %, Recovery Rate %.

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Analysis & Visualizations  
Key visuals used:  
- **KPI Cards** ‚Äî Total Cases (829M), Deaths (43.38M), Recoveries (388.41M), Active Cases (26M)  
- **Donut Charts** ‚Äî Recovery Rate by Country  
- **Bar Charts** ‚Äî Death Rate by Country, Regional Case Comparison  
- **Clustered Columns** ‚Äî Total Cases, Deaths, and Recoveries by WHO Region  
- **Slicers** ‚Äî Interactive filters by Country and WHO Region

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Insights & Problems Solved  
This analysis addressed critical questions and produced actionable insights:  

| Problem | Analytical Insight |
|----------|--------------------|
| Which regions had the highest infection and fatality rates? | The **Americas** and **Europe** recorded the most cases and deaths. |
| How do recovery trends compare across countries? | **Liechtenstein**, **New Zealand**, and **Mauritius** showed recovery rates above 90%. |
| Where were active cases still rising? | Concentrated growth in the **Americas** and **Western Pacific** regions. |
| What was the overall recovery-to-death ratio? | Roughly **9 recoveries : 1 death**, indicating strong recovery in most nations. |

‚úÖ **Problem Solved:** The dashboard transformed raw, disorganized COVID-19 data into a clear visual tool that aids global comparison, public-health evaluation, and policy planning.  

---

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ Conclusion & Recommendations  
- Power BI offers a reliable approach for tracking global pandemics through visual analytics.  
- Real-time regional breakdowns help governments allocate medical resources effectively.  
- Integrating **vaccination** and **testing-rate** data could enhance the analytical depth.  
- Future enhancements: forecasting models using SQL-powered datasets and Power BI predictive visuals.
